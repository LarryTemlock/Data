\f0\fs28 \cf2 \cb3 Griffin spoke around a mouthful of food. \'91What\'92s it like being blind?\'92 \'91Do you think about what it\'92s like to have hair every second?\'92 Cheyenne blew air out of her nose. \'91It\'92s just who I am now. I try not to think about it all the time.\'92 Which was true. But it didn\'92t work. She never really forgot that she was blind. And even if she did for a minute, she could count on there being a reminder. Usually painful. She sighed. \'91At first, it feels like someone has thrown a blanket over your head. Some days you just want to scream, \'91I\'92m inside here! Doesn\'92t anybody out there see that? Doesn\'92t anybody remember me? I\'92m still the same person!\'92 \'94 Cheyenne fell silent. She knew the last sentence wasn\'92t true, even if she wanted it to be. She wasn\'92t the same person.\cb1 \

Now here she was, blind, kidnapped, tied up, and going who knows where with a criminal. Her cell phone was gone. And she was very sick. No! Cheyenne mouthed the word to herself. She had to stay on track. Think. She was blind. That was a fact. That was her greatest weakness. But could she somehow use it to her advantage? And there were a few advantages to being blind\'97not many, certainly not enough. But a few. For one thing, she knew how to use all her other senses in a way that most sighted people never did. \
\
They smelled and heard and touched all the same things she did, but they had let that part of their brain go numb with disuse, so the sensations didn\'92t register. And Cheyenne had learned the hard way to always, always pay attention to what was around her, to pick up as many clues as she could. So how could she use her senses to her advantage?

\f0\fs28 \cf2 \cb3 Right now she must be moving as fast as she could through the woods, knowing that the only thing she had on her side was a little bit of time. Griffin felt a grudging respect. He stepped up on the toilet seat and grabbed the casement. He was just swinging his leg out when the faintest of sounds made him look toward the tub. Now that he was two feet off the ground, he could just see over the blue shower curtain with its faded green and yellow seahorses. And what he saw was Cheyenne, crouched in the tub. Hiding behind the shower curtain.\cb1 \
