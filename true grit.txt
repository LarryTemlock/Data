\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 We were told that the Indian's neck had not been broken, as was the case with the other two, and that he swung there and strangled for more than half an hour before a doctor pronounced him dead and had him lowered.\

Mattie doesn't exactly seem to disapprove of the death penalty, but she does describe it in such a way as to make us think that hanging can be really, really brutal and drawn out. Notice how she spends more time describing his death than the other men's? Her description is drawn out, just like his death. Creepy.\
\
I have since learned that Judge Isaac Parker watched all the hangings from an upper window in the Courthouse. I suppose he did this from a sense of duty. There is no knowing what's in a man's heart.\
\
The prisoners see Judge Parker as the human face of a justice system that they believe is treating them unjustly. They can't separate the man from the system of justice he represents\'97but the death penalty isn't dying with Parker.\
\
People do not give credence that a fourteen-year-old-girl could leave home and go off in the wintertime to avenge her father's blood but it did not seem so strange then, although I will say it didn't happen every day.\'a0\
\
Things have changed in the fifty years since Mattie was a girl. Pros: Women can vote! Cons: Teenage girls can't just run off on blood-quests. Hm, sounds like a toss-up to us.\
\
Mattie has some strong ideas about how a real man should act. The drummers she's talking about don't play drums but are traveling salesmen who "drum-up" business, which apparently isn't a manly profession. (Marshaling, on the other hand, is about a dudely as you can get.)\
\
Manly ways to die include hanging and being shot while trying to keep your hired hand from heading off to shoot some gamblers; unmanly ways to die include \'85 what? Probably anything involving whining or begging.\
\
Mattie feels sorry for these chained up prisoners at first, but she gets judgmental pretty quickly. It doesn't seem to enter her mind that some of these men are innocent, or that some of the crimes that the punishments they are receiving might not fit the crimes.\
\
This attorney sees Rooster as a hired killer and as a menace to society. Mattie sees him as a bringer of justice. How do you think he sees himself?\
\
No wonder Mattie doesn't trust the law: they don't even have Tom Chaney's name right. On the other hand, neither does Mattie. Chaney's real name is Theron Chelmsford, and lawman LaBoeuf is the only one who knows that.}
